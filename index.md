## Help wanted
* Experd/nerd-competence needed for exploring and documenting how the old windows XP based Clinergy demo can be installed and run in emulators on Linux and Windows 10+
* Website editing
* Creation of pedagogical material from interviews and PEN&PAD-related papers (focused video snippets, transcriptions, summaries, tutorials etc.) in order to inspire a new generation of developers, clinicians and informaticians to revive the PEN & PAD approach using the tools available today.

## Challenge
This can be suitable as student projects, hackathon challenges, personal learning projects etc. 
* Use low/no-code tools to recreate appraches from PEN & PAD... 
* ...then fork this repository, and create a subdirectory of your own under the `challenge` subdirectory with a readme.md file including a description (and links to your project site if available) including ways to contact you.
* Add other relevant description-related files (like screenshots) in your subdirectory.
* Then edit the readme file in the `challenge` directory to include a describing title with a link to your subdirectory
* Finally submit a pull request so that we can include your addition here.

Ask a local GIT-nerd for help if the process above sounds too complicated.
